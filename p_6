# You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for clarification.
# Sample Input
# 4
# bcdef
# abcdefg
# bcde
# bcdef
# Sample Output
# 3
# 2 1 1
# Explanation: There are 3 distinct words. Here, "bcdef" appears twice in the input at the first and last positions. The other words appear once each. The order of the first appearances are "bcdef", "abcdefg" and "bcde" which corresponds to the output.

n = int(input())  # take int input
arr = []
for i in range(n):  # loop for append elements in arr
    s = input()
    arr.append(s)

set1 = set(arr)  # convert arr into set to reduce duplication
print(len(set1))  # print total distinct number of elements
arr2 = []
arr3 = []
for i in arr:  # loop for count the total number of duplication of each word
    if i in arr2:  # if elements at ith index  present in arr2 then pass
        pass
    else:
        arr2.append(i)  # else append that element into arr2
        # count the duplication of perticular element and append in arr3
        arr3.append(arr.count(i))
for i in arr3:
    print(i, end=' ')  # print the count
